# Krita Aseprite file plugin

![](demo.png)

Plugin for loading aseprite files in Krita.

## Usage

`Tools -> Scripts -> Open Aseprite file...`

## What works

This plugin is very wip! So far the plugin has support for loading Aseprite files by creating a new document and adding all layers.

Some things currently not implemented:
- Saving _to_ `.aseprite` / `.ase`
- Files with more than one frame (it _will_ load, but only the first layer)
- Anything involving tiles / tilesets
- etc...
